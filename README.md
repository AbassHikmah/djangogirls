Do check your blog app!
You either do not have a urls.py in it or forgot to add it to git before pushing your code
Add it again by running: git add .
and then push with: git push -u origin master
provided you have correctly set your repository to contain an origin,
if not, then: add it and push or use your desired method to push.

Best of luck!
Well done!
